During the development of this project, I encountered numerous difficulties. For one, I found that the very specific spacing of ppm files made it necessary to ensure my readPixel and readHeader functions were exact with how they read in each character, and to make sure that when writing to the output file, I had to ensure that every character was perfectly placed, including \n characters. I solved this issue by using a series of getc() and ungetc() functions to ensure throughout the execution of every function, that the file pointer was being properly aligned for future use, and to ensure that the output file was a correctly formatted ppm file. The hardest problem I dealt with was for some reason on my windows laptop, everything for my program seemed to be functioning properly, but the output.ppm file would look black and white, and completely skewed to the right. I debugged my code on my laptop for hours and couldn't fix it, but when I tested it on the SoC machine, the ppm file looked fine. I can attribute this issue to some difference between the operating systems for encoding and editing the ppm files.

Overall, I very much enjoyed this project. Although it took an incredibly long amount of time to complete, when it compiled and worked I was overjoyed. Additionally, this GREATLY IMPROVED my overall confidence with the C language, and working with command line arguments and reading and writing between files. I truly enjoyed working on (especially when it finally worked) this project.
